Every treat is handled with care, and the gluten-free line is mixed with separate equipment in a separate kitchen.
Sugar Whipped Bakery works under the belief that all foods should taste good without any artificial ingredients. With a variety of unique—as well as traditional—flavors of cupcakes, whoopie pies, cake pops, and gourmet marshmallows, Sugar Whipped Bakery operates with the goal of producing all-natural treats with a homemade feel.
